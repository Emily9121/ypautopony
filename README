YayPonies AutoPony 1.1
-------------------------------------
YP tools are provided as it is, there might or might not
be a README, we warranty absolutely nothing, it does work for us.
-------------------------------------

What it does :

Correctly configurated, it take iTunes ponies (with DRM), remove DRM, check the episode name on 
thetvdb and remux (with correct info) the episodes, creating a publishable file, or files.

It's able to do both 720P and 1080P in the same time.
---

How it work :

Autopony doesn't take argument from command line, the config file is the only place where you need to 
configure things, when configured properly, it will work as soon as you launch it.
---

Config files :

>> definition of commands

A cmd has a name, and includes everything up to the next empty line

the variables can be formatted in a more complex manner, see:
http://docs.python.org/library/string.html#formatspec
for example, {_EPNAME:02d} will format _EPNAME to be padded with zeroes
to be two letters long.

>> definition of variables

Vars that used by commands need to be definied at this part, those vars are:

Input directory, this is used as base path for the filenames in commands,
and there needs to be one DIR_IN_COMMAND for each command, it's used for MKVMerge!
DIR_IN_COMMAND  B:\COMMAND

DIR_IN_UNDRM is the variable used to define path of iTunes DRM'd file.
Example : DIR_IN_UNDRM  B:\iTunes Data\iTunes\iTunes Media\TV Shows\My Little Pony_ Friendship Is Magic

>> Options

DRY_RUN (yes|no) = If this option is enabled, Autopony will print instead of launching command, used for debugging.
SEASON (1-9) = Define season of pony.

>> Variable parts 2

The variable at this point of the config files define path for applications and path for output (And subtitles input).

On the default configuration : 

PATH_REQUIEM C:\yayponies\requiem\requiem.exe > Define that requiem (Used to remove DRM) is in C:\yayponies\requiem\requiem.exe
PATH_MKVMERGE C:\MKVToolNix\mkvmerge.exe > Define that mkvmerge (Used to remux video) is in C:\MKVToolNix\mkvmerge.exe
DIR_SUBTITLES C:\Users\YayPonies\Sub > Define that subtitles (Used only on *R files) are in C:\Users\YayPonies\Sub
DIR_OUT_UNDRM b:\UnDRM\ > Tell Requiem to put the unprotected file in b:\UnDRM\
DIR_OUT_** B:\ > Tell MKVMerge to put finished videos file from format ** to B:\

>> 1080P or 720P

When enabled, those lines :
	?1080P Is this 1080p hd?
	1080P_1 1080
	1080P_0 720
will make Autopony ask you what format you're doing, its only important when removing DRM, if enabled awnsering yes will put
1080P files in a folder named 1080, 720P under 720, following the exemple, since DIR_OUT_UNDRM is b:\UnDRM, files will instead
be in b:\UnDRM\1080 and b:\UnDRM\720.

>> COMMANDS

Where you define actual command,

the * is a wildcard and completes if the filename is unique
if you have 1 to 26 in a list like this, you can just un-comment
The episode you want to process and run the script

explicit filenames are possible as well, of course.

so, if you have two file in the DIR_IN_UNDRM folder named 01.Derpy.m4v and 02.Hooves.m4v,

UnDRM 0* > Will remove DRM from both files
UnDRM 01* > Will remove DRM from 01.Derpy.m4v
UnDRM 01.Derpy.m4v > Will remove DRM from 01.Derpy.m4v
UnDRM 0 or UnDRM 01 > Will fail.

Please look at definied command in the first part to know what command is working!
